# Wage-Calculator
A shell based program to help keep track of daily, weekly, and monthly wages. Given input for hourly wage, hours worked, and tips earned will do the math and output approximate wages for the day, and add the day to it's log.
Given at least seven entries in the log it will also give you an output of the total for the week, and the same for the month given four weeks worth of logs.

**Disclaimer:** This program is for personal use and should not be used for business purposes as it is not capable of handling floating point integers, and thus outputs are approximate!

**Installation:** Drop the scripts into a directory of your choosing (I recommend /usr/local/bin), and do `chmod +x` on them. For the GAUSS script, move to your home folder as a hidden file `~/.GAUSS` after `chmod`ing, as it is used for colorizing `WCalc`'s output.
